# Image Facial Recognition with Hive Predict

This is a simple, generic example of a custom facial recognition skill for images using the [Box Skills Kit](https://github.com/box/box-skills-kit-nodejs)
and [Hive Predict](https://thehive.ai/docs#hive-predict-api).

Hive offers image classification as a service, and can provide a custom model that is trained to classify faces for your specific use case. 
For more info on Hive's API, please refer to their [docs](https://thehive.ai/docs#hive-predict-api).
